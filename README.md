## Description

The game allows players to log in as individual users and either start a new game or resume a previously saved game in progress. The game will store player data on a database, storing information such as player location on the map and player inventory of items as a saved game. Inventories will also be generated for towns on the map that will randomly generate inventories of commodities that can be traded with the player.
